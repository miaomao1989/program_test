# 9. IVSHMEM Library

The DPDK IVSHMEM library facilitates fast zero-copy data sharing among virtual machines (host-to-guest or guest-to-guest) by means of QEMUâ€™s IVSHMEM mechanism.

The library works by providing a command line for QEMU to map several hugepages into a single IVSHMEM device. For the guest to know what is inside any given IVSHMEM device (and to distinguish between DPDK and non-DPDK IVSHMEM devices), a metadata file is also mapped into the IVSHMEM segment. No work needs to be done by the guest application to map IVSHMEM devices into memory; they are automatically recognized by the DPDK Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL).
